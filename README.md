### Focus Areas: What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?
For UI/UX I focused on the recipe card that I used to display a recipe. I wanted to make it simple but apealing to look at using rounded edges and shadows. I did this because I wanted the main aspect of the app to look nice. For the app itself, I focused on caching images and retrieving them to serve up and display. I did this because loading that many images over and over again while scrolling through recipes could lead to bad app proformace where it's slow or visually laggy.

### Time Spent: Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?
I spent about 5-6 hours on this project. I allocated most of my time to getting the recipes displaying nicely and the images caching properly. Then I prioritized testing after.

### Trade-offs and Decisions: Did you make any significant trade-offs in your approach?
Using caching was something I prioritized but it still comes with trade offs. For example, it improves proformance which I wanted and needed but can lead to more storage being taken up and a larger app size. This wasn't a huge concern in this project but a much larger one could cause more concerns. Also, caching can result in stale or outdated data if it is stored for a long time and changes without the app knowing. Lastly, there were some trade offs for the UI design. I wanted something simple and easy to use so I went with a large scroll view that has all of the recipes in it. This was nice but also has some cons where its hard to find specific recipes if you were looking. With more time it would be nice to add some features like being able to search or sort the data by cuisine or by name.

### Weakest Part of the Project: What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I think I could have used some more testing to better cover all cases and ensure the function calls are working properly. I also think the UI restrictions above would add some usability challenges. I think it would be hard to find specific recipes and a way to sort through them would be very nice and imrpove the design a lot.

### Additional Information: Is there anything else we should know? Feel free to share any insights or constraints you encountered.
I know I said that there were some design and feature improvements but overall I like the look and feel of the design and think it behaves nicely.
